# Recipe Box

This is the [third project](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-recipe-box) for freeCodeCamp's Data Visualization certificate.

Completed On: 12 March 2017  

## Objectives

Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/xVXWag/

**Rule #1**: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

**Rule #2**: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

**Rule #3**: You must use both Sass and React to build this project.

## User Stories

- I can create recipes that have names and ingredients.
- I can see an index view where the names of all the recipes are visible.
- I can click into any of those recipes to view it.
- I can edit these recipes.
- I can delete these recipes.
- All new recipes I add are saved in my browser's local storage. If I refresh the page, these recipes will still be there.
